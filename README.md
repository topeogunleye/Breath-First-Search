# Breath-First-Search
Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is a way to traverse through a graph. Its goal is to check all of the graph's nodes (like in the case of BFS). DFS starts with a given node and then "visits" the first unvisited node from the nodes that are directly connected with that initial node. From that second node, it goes to the first unvisited node from the nodes that are directly connected with that second node, and the process repeats until it reaches the node that has no connection with unvisited nodes. When that happens, DFS goes backward on the same path to find nodes to traverse.
